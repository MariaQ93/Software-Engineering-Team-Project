# Software Engineering Team Project
Project Overview

This repository contains the artifacts for our final project submission in CS 1530: Software Engineering. Our team embarked on an exciting journey to model Scrum software development and create the foundation of bank data integration and budget management tool.

Goal
The primary goal of this project was to simulate a real-world software development environment using Scrum methodology and to develop a foundational structure for a bank data integration and budget management tool

Team Composition

Developers: All team members
Product Owner: Menghao Hu
Scrum Master: Liyin Qin
Each member contributed as a developer, with some holding dual roles as either the Product Owner or Scrum Master.

Our development process was rooted in the principles of Scrum. We began by defining the problem statement and then moved on to convert the first five functional requirements into backlog items. Key steps in our process included:

Initial Planning:
Discussion of the problem statement.
Conversion of functional requirements into backlog items.
Timeline and Availability:
