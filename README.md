# Software Engineering Team Project
#Project Overview

This repository contains the artifacts for our final project submission in CS 1530: Software Engineering. Our team embarked on an exciting journey to model Scrum software development and create the foundation of a coding challenge game designed for people of all ages.

#Goal
The primary goal of this project was to simulate a real-world software development environment using Scrum methodology and to develop a foundational structure for a coding challenge game that is engaging and educational.

#Team Composition

Developers: All team members
Product Owner: Menghao Hu
Scrum Master: Liyin Qin
Each member contributed as a developer, with some holding dual roles as either the Product Owner or Scrum Master.

#Development Process

Our development process was rooted in the principles of Scrum. We began by defining the problem statement and then moved on to convert the first five functional requirements into backlog items. Key steps in our process included:

Initial Planning:
Discussion of the problem statement.
Conversion of functional requirements into backlog items.
Timeline and Availability:
Establishing a clear timeline.
Understanding each team member's availability.
Scrum Ceremonies:
Conducting regular meetings, standups, and sprint reviews.
Ensuring adherence to Scrum processes.
Development and Collaboration:
Working on ticket items both individually and collaboratively.
Conducting code reviews and progress demonstrations.
Achievements

By the end of two sprints, our team successfully achieved the following:

Deployment Model: Transformed the first two functional requirements into a deployment model.
Working GUI: Developed a functional and user-friendly graphical user interface for the game.
